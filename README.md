# PN-Sequence-Generator_MATLAB

### Introduction:
Pseudo Noise (PN) sequences plays an important role in spread-spectrum communication system by spreading the bandwidth of information-bearing (data) signal to the noise level and provides immunity to jamming. The PN sequence is a periodic binary sequence with a noise-like waveform, usually generated by means of a feedback shift register involving a logical operation. The purpose of this lab experiment is to explore the generation of PN sequence and understand its properties by using digital computers and the Matlab/Octave software environment.

### Requirements:
Digital Computer with MATLAB software.
